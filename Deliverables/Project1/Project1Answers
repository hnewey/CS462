1. Do you get the same result? Why or why not?
>>>I do get the same result because both events are using the same ruleset even though they're coming from different channels.

2. What happens? Why?
>>>I get the error:
{"error":"Key not found in database [channel,cj2jnok050000tndu30dj733h,pico_id]"} because the channel key was deleted so it couldn't be found.

3. What do you observe? Why?
>>>I get the following:
{"directives":[]}
This is because the rule we have defined in our ruleset specifies a directive when "echo hello" so it doesn't have any directives to return when we request "ecco hello". If we add a new ruleset and include "select when ecco hello", any specified directives will be returned.
