1. With a regex? I'm not sure what this question is refering to.

2. I used an event expression with a regex looking for a positive number. One advantage of using a rule conditional is that my regex is much less readable and isn't as flexible. If we use a rule conditional, we can write our own functions to test a bunch of different things for that conditional. One advantage of my regex however, is the code is much cleaner and takes up less space which can help with understanding code flow.

3. The output of my ruleset was just the output of process_trips. One directive was returned which makes sense since I only have one directive at this point in my code. Two rules were selected and two rules fired according to my debug logs. The second rule that fired raised an event that doesn't give any directives so we don't get any output for that one.

4. The output was two directives which again makes sense since my second rule (find_long_trips) doesn't send a directive. According to my logs, all three rules were called and all fired

5.

6. Give it a fallback value of city MPG and if that isn't returned either, have a default value.

7. Yes it is. It looks for an event to fire then it doesn't do anything besides turn around and fire off a new event. 

8. event: 
   { eci: 'cj2tmxid50001zqdutlpe3l5y',
     eid: '1556',
     domain: 'explicit',
     type: 'trip_processed' },
  eci: 'cj2tmxid50001zqdutlpe3l5y' } rule selected: track_trips -> find_long_trips
[DEBUG] { rid: 'track_trips',
  pico_id: 'cj2tmxid30000zqdu0z6qcphl',
  event: 
   { eci: 'cj2tmxid50001zqdutlpe3l5y',
     eid: '1556',
     domain: 'explicit',
     type: 'trip_processed' },
  eci: 'cj2tmxid50001zqdutlpe3l5y' } fired

This shows that the rule find_long_trips is being selected properly and it ends up firing.
